# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction
This repository houses the Python notebook and required datasets for predicting the risk of diabetes in patients. 

Problem Statement:
To predict the risk of diabetes in patients given the health attributes.

Dataset Used:
The dataset used in this project is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset used here has 16 independant features and a dependent variable.

Short Description:
The steps followed in this project are as follows.
  1) Importing Libraries and Dataset
  2) Exploratory Data Analysis
  3) Hypothesis Testing
  4) Feature Transformation
  5) Predictive Modelling
  
Importing Libraries:
The libraries used here are Numpy (Matrix Operations), Pandas (Data Manipulation), Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data Visualization), Scipy (Independant T-Testing), Sklearn (Machine Learning Algorithms and Metrics).

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Univariate and Bivariate analysis are done to uncover the trends in the dataset.

Hypothesis Testing:
Independant T-Testing is performed to check whether the feature 'Age' has any relation with the target variable.

Feature Transformation:
Variables are encoded and dummy variables are created accordingly.

Predictive Modelling:
Baseline models are created at the initial stage and the results obtained are compared. The evaluation metrics used here are accuracy score and f1-score. Averaging, Bagging and Boosting techniques are performed in the subsequent steps.
